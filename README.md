This microservice provides support for getting a document with an assigned DocumentID, Personal number and Text.

Currently not 100% working on macOS due to unsupported packages in for the PDF-converter... (Might work on PC)

To build and run use "docker compose up" for the docker-compose.yml in _DocumentService/App folder_.
Use the GET endpoint in the DocumentService API to fetch your document.
